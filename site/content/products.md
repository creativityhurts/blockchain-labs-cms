  heading: What is Blockchain?
  description: >-
    A blockchain is a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions that have ever
    been executed. It is constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks are added to
    it with a new set of recordings. The blocks are added to the blockchain in a
    linear, chronological order. Each node (computer connected to the Bitcoin
    network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying
    transactions) gets a copy of the blockchain, which gets downloaded
    automatically upon joining the Bitcoin network. The blockchain has complete
    information about the addresses and their balances right from the genesis
    block to the most recently completed block.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
